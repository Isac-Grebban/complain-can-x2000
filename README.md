# Complain Can 🪙

A fun team application to collect "complaints" and turn them into team treats! Every complaint adds a coin to the can, building up funds for the next team beer or coffee run.

##  Quick Start

**Deploy to GitHub Pages** (no server required):
1. **[� Follow Quick-Start Guide](./docs/QUICK-START.md)** (~10 minutes)
2. **[� Local Development](./docs/LOCAL-DEVELOPMENT.md)** (instant setup)

**Why GitHub Pages?** Uses GitHub Gists as backend storage - no server maintenance needed!

## ✨ Features

- 🪙 **Coin Collection**: Add coins for team members who complain
- 💰 **Automatic Calculation**: Converts complaints to SEK for treat funding  
- 🏆 **Leaderboard**: See who's contributing most to the treat fund
- 🔐 **Email Authentication**: Authorized team members only
- 🎵 **Sound Effects**: Satisfying coin drop sounds
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no build process)

- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

## 💻 Local Development

No GitHub setup required for local testing:
